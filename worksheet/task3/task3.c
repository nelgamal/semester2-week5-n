// Worksheet 2.5

/* 
 * Task 3 - extension task
 * Implement a C program that demonstrates an input validation loop with the following requirements:
 * 1. Prompt the person to enter a password that must:
 *    a. Be at least 8 characters long
 *    b. Contain at least one uppercase letter
 *    c. Contain at least one number
 *    d. Contain at least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
 * 2.	Use an appropriate loop structure to continue prompting until a valid password is entered
 * 3.	After a successful password entry, ask if they want to validate another password (y/n)
 * 4.	Use an appropriate outer loop to continue the program until the person chooses to exit
 * This task requires combining nested loops with string processing and character checking.
